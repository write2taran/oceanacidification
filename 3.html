<p align =left><font size=6 color=orange><em>Main reason for Ocean Acidification, is increase in the carbon dioxide emissions and reduction in planet's abilty to break it down. The following factors contribute to it:-</em></font></p>
<p align =left><font size=5 color=
#000080><ol>
<li><u>Burning of fossil fuels</u>- This constitutes 87% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions. Burning these fuels releases energy which is most commonly turned into heat, electricity or power for transportation.

<li><u>Changes of land use</u>- When the natural environment is converted into areas for human use like agricultural land or settlements this is called changes of land use. Land use and land use change, releases billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

<li><u>The industrial revolution</u>- The raw materials used in most of the industries especially in the  manufacturing sector  like cement industry, steel manufacturing etc are fossil fuels. They burn out to produce co<sub>2</sub> in the environment. 
<li><u>Transportation sector</u>- Automobiles, freight and light-duty trucks are the main sources of emissions for the whole transport sector and emissions from these three have steadily grown since past many years.

<li><u>Deforestation</u>- it reduces the amount of trees, this also reduces how much carbon dioxide can be removed by the Earth's forests. When deforestation is done to create new agricultural land, the crops that replace the trees also act as a carbon sink, but they are not as effective as forests.
<li><u>Volcanic eruptions</u>- They release magma, ash, dust and gases from deep below the Earth's surface. One of the gases released is carbon dioxide adding up to the total quantity of Carbon Dioxide in atmosphere.
