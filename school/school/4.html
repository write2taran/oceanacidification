<li><u>Loss of Biodiversity</u> - Due to Ocean Acidification, calcium carbonate ions become less populated in seawater. This leads to the non-calcification of Oysters, clams, sea urchins, coral and plankton thus posing a threat to reproduction, growth, and survival at species level resulting in loss of biodiversity.
<li><u>Food Web Interruption</u> - All life forms within the Ocean play an important role in maintaining the Marine Food Web. Dangers to the Biodiversity in the Ocean not only affect the Marine food web, but the human food web too. Tainted fish and sea life will be unfit to be consumed by other animals in the sea, or even by humans.

<li><u>Disruption to local Economies</u> – Local Economies will suffer because Fisherman will be unable to produce food for the community, thus prices of many commodities will rise leading to undesired changes in local economies.
<li><u>Tourism is halted</u> - Tourism will decline when coastal communities are tainted and species relative to the oceans, which attract many onlookers, become extinct.
<li><u>Water supply’s contamination</u> - Water supplies, not only in the ocean but water in the waterways will also become polluted and become unfit for use by many species.
