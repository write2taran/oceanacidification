#000080>Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH<sup>*</sup> of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere. Seawater is slightly basic (meaning pH<sup>*</sup>  > 7), and the process in question is a shift towards pH<sup>*</sup> -neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions (pH<sup>*</sup>  < 7). Ocean alkalinity is not changed by the process, or may increase over long time periods due to carbonate dissolution. An estimated 30–40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes. To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid. Some of these extra carbonic acid molecules react with a water molecule to give a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion, thus increasing ocean acidity (H+ ion concentration). Between years 1751 and 1994, surface ocean pH<sup>*</sup>  is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14, representing an increase of almost 30% in H+ ion concentration in the world's oceans. Earth System Model projects that, within the last decade ocean acidity exceeded historical analogy and in combination with other ocean biochemical changes, could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision of many goods and services associated with the ocean.
